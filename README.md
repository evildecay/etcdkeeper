## Features

* Content edits use the ace editor[(Ace editor)](https://ace.c9.io). Support toml,ini,yaml,json,xml and so on to highlight view.
* Content format. (Currently only support json, Other types can be extended later) Thanks jim3ma for his contribution.[@jim3ma]( https://github.com/jim3ma)

## Future Features
* Import and export.
* Content simple filter search.

## Special Note
Because the etcdv3 version uses the new storage concept, without the catalog concept, the client uses the previous default "/" delimiter to view. See the documentation for etcdv3 [clientv3 doc](https://godoc.org/github.com/coreos/etcd/clientv3).
